### Monday
 - Formed pipeline for evaluating classifiers

### Tuesday
 - Generated ROC-plots of all [Caltech Pedeatrian Detection results](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/datasets/INRIA/res/). It's for my experience of generating such ROC-curves via `Matlab evaluating and labeling code`

### Wednesday
 - Wrote `pedestrian detection sample` via OpenCV Cascade Classifier

### Friday
 - Fixed errors in object detect source code. The `CascadeClassifier` class doesn't work with pedestrian cascade classifiers.

### Saturday
 - Rewrite code of `peopledetect` sample from OpenCV samples. The sample uses HOG-detector. Took results of pedestrian detection on INRIA test data.

### Sunday
 - Evaluated HOG-detector from OpenCV (generated ROC-plots)
