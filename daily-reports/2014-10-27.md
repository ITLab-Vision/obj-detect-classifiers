### Tuesday
 - Read the [ICF Detector documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/xobjdetect/doc/integral_channel_features.html)
 - Read some short articles about ROC-curves

### Thursday
 - Done a prompt of running ICF Detector training code

### Saturday
 - Trained ICF Detector by the part of positive and negative images of INRIA dataset (20-bg and 20-fg images)
